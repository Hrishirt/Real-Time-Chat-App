## What I Learned

This project helped me understand how to build a complete real-time web application from scratch. I learned how to:

- Build secure authentication flows using JWT and bcrypt
- Implement real-time functionality using Socket.io
- Manage application state efficiently with Zustand
- Encrypt messages client-side and store them securely
- Structure a full-stack app with modular design and proper error handling
- Integrate image uploads and CDN delivery with Cloudinary
